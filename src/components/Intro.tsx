      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <p>
        I&apos;m Brandon Dong, a full-stack web developer from Riverside, CA. I
        have skills in a variety of front-end and back-end technologies, such as
        React.js and Express.js, across multiple languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        After getting my Statistics degree and spending years in the retail
        industry, I&apos;ve developed a wide array of skills in problem-solving,
        interpersonal communication, and user-oriented design that I&apos;d like
        to bring to web technologies to help build fun and exciting projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I&apos;m not programming for work or education, I&apos;m usually
        programming for fun like making Minecraft mods. I also do some gaming
        now and then.
      </p>
